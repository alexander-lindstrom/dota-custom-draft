todo:
	
	Proper reset button (fully resets the state)
	Popconfirm when picking/banning hero?
	Use socket id: https://socket.io/docs/v3/server-socket-instance/ to control who can b/p?
	Display the current state that we are in. As in "not started", "dire pick", etc.
	
bugs:
	Dire reserve becomes dire_reserve_time etc.
	this happens sometimes (unclear if there is incorrect behaviour): localhost/:1 Unchecked runtime.lastError: A 
		listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
	timers etc don't stop when the draft has ended
