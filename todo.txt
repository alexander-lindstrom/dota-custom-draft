todo:
	
	radiant/dire information in rows in some reasonable way. Add a status column. As in "active", "waiting" or whatever. Probably actually use bootstrap.
	Bootstrap modal when picking/banning hero? Only if it doesnt look awful. Another option is adding a tooltip.
		Idea: Link to page with changelog/information in tooltip.
	Proper reset button (fully resets the state)
	
	
	
	
bugs:
	Dire reserve becomes dire_reserve_time etc.
	this happens sometimes (unclear if there is incorrect behaviour): localhost/:1 Unchecked runtime.lastError: A 
		listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
	Something keeps going when the draft has ended
