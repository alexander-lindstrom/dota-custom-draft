todo:
	
	Check for draft end when picking
	Confirmation when picking banning? Only if it doesnt look awful. Another option is adding a tooltip.
		Idea: Link to page with changelog/information in tooltip.
	Copy draft to clipboard option
	
	
	
	
bugs:
	Dire reserve becomes dire_reserve_time etc.
	this happens sometimes (unclear if there is incorrect behaviour): localhost/:1 Unchecked runtime.lastError: A 
		listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
	Something keeps going when the draft has ended
