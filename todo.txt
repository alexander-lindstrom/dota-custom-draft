Issues:


Future improvements:
*Some kind of confirmation when picking/banning
*Better way of showing whose turn it is, how many bans, picks there are and so on.
*Support refreshing/new users connecting after draft has started. 
    The server would send the full state to the client that has just connected.
    So the client initial state must be dynamically constructed.
