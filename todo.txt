	Visual improvements - how?
	Allow captains to change some settings?
		For example starting side(requires making it possible for dire to start), pick/reserve time, heroes per type, number of bans, etc.
		One example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24949285/drop-down-list-inside-a-pop-up-window-comes-up-when-button-is-pressed
	Confirmation when picking banning? Only if it doesnt look awful. Another option is adding a tooltip.
		Idea: Link to page with changelog/information in tooltip.
