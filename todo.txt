todo:
	
	Visual improvements - how?
	Allow captains to change some settings? 
		For example starting side(requires making it possible for dire to start), pick/reserve time, heroes per type, number of bans, etc.
	Confirmation when picking banning? Only if it doesnt look awful. Another option is adding a tooltip.
		Idea: Link to page with changelog/information in tooltip.
	
	
	
	
bugs:
	this happens sometimes (unclear if there is incorrect behaviour): localhost/:1 Unchecked runtime.lastError: A 
		listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
	when resetting - pck/ban headers disappear
